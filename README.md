# Dukaan Storefront Interface

A storefront interface built using Java, Netbeans Swing GUI at the front-end and SQLite at the back-end. 

The program provides a user-friendly interface to keep track of a store's inventory, register sales and look at sale statistics. 
Every invoice is registered and can be printed out on the spot. Invoices can be retrieved by their invoice number or customer name. 
Reports of invoices in a particular date range can also be retrieved.

Further, the program is capable of maintaining a reorder list of inventory items that reach below a particular quantity. 
The program also provides basic accounting functionality and can calculate current cash balance as well as revenue and profit reports for any specified time period.

The platform provides a login screen and is password protected. Access is only granted to credentials present in the worker database. 
Users are segregated into 'Admin' and 'Volunteer' type with variable functionality. 
For example, the feature of examining ang maintaining details of valid users on the platform is restricted only to admins. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) - Used for Swing GUI
* [Java 7](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) - Development
* [SQLite](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) - Or any alternative SQLite workbench

### Installing and Deployment

Setup your database on your workbench and then link it in the code. 
In ComputerScienceIA.java in the source code, replace your database location in line 37.

```
String url = "jdbc:sqlite:/Users/mac/Desktop/products.db";
```

## Program Functionality

The billing screen autogenerates a bill number and fills up the fields for billing automatically after a product is selected by name. The relevant billing information is added to a table displayed which can be printed.

The bill records screen allows a user to search for any bills given a particular customer name, a date range or the bill number. This data is displayed in a table and can be printed.
